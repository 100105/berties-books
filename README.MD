####
the database credentials were moved from index.js and put into a .env file using dotenv module

we did this becayse it improves security by making sure passwords weren't being stored in public coded that everyone can ee

the .env file was put into .gitignore but you can still mark it because i used the variables you shared 

the .env used are loaded in index.js in the require dotenv line
